I visited my little brother a few years back while he was interning. Since the place
was out of the way of most things, I spent a couple days writing this toy RPG engine.

To run it, you just need Ruby + Gosu.

Go to the main directory and run:
ruby -I. main.rb

Since it was hacked together, I can't guarentee it'll be easy to get working, so here are a couple screenshots from it actually running.

Note! The graphics and audio are NOT mine. I just threw in some things I had laying around from the RPG Maker 95 era to test the engine.

Also, shoutouts to Thorbj√∏rn Lindeijer and everyone involved in Tiled!
